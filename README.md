# family-tree-model
A data model for genealogy family trees

Genealygy software need to use a form of tree structure to handle the structure of families and individuals in a family tree, 
but using a normal tree structure is often not ideal. 

Many genealogical data structures use two types of nodes, family-nodes, and individual-nodes. 
These are then double-linked to each other to connect family members and related famililies to each other. 

This is an attempt to create such an open source, free data model that can be reused by any application that needs to use 
family-trees in a frontend environment.
